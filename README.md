# coreBOSOpenKM
coreBOS-OpenKM integration

This project was born in 2012 but never really got off the ground. We did some basic steps, which I share here, before abandoning the project.

In May 2016 one of our community members gave it another shot and ended up abandoning it because OpenKM wasn't living up to his needs.

He did get it working to a very interesting and useful state and then enhanced that to work with LogicalDoc, and he even shared the code with us!!

This extension is operative. For sure it will need debuging, love and care, but it is a VERY good start.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you want to pick it up, either on OpenKM or LogicalDoc
