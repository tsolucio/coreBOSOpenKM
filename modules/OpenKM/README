Adaptation with LogicalDoc 

- install module
- apply patch in modules/OpenKM/OpenKM.diff
- add Global Variable Document_UseOpenKM to changeSets/DefineGlobalVariables.php
- copy modules/OpenKM/changeSets/InstallOpenKM.xml to modules/cbupdater/cbupdates
- load and apply corebos updater

i have made the changes :
- support for LogicalDoc instead of OpenKM (however openkm code still works)
- per user login and creation of users in LD , i have added a field okmpassword in vtiger_users which keep the plain password - i don't know why for admin the encrypted password works but for normal users no

The document module is now out of use 
i did not develop on this (creation of folders,....) as LD already provide everything. 

i did not delete the file in storage after it is saved in LD : this can be done 

there is still one issue :
opening LD in an iframe just make it freeze , seems a javascript error on cache file

for LD--> CB, i'm thinking of a script that will run in scheduler and create the documents in CB for each documents in LD 
you'll see in vtiger_attachments there is a field okmuuid which represent the LD id. 

i had an issue on creating the user on LD. thanks to the forum (http://forums.logicaldoc.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9069&p=14149#p14149)

the groups are now well inserted for the user
